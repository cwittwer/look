Image taken from : https://jooinn.com/people-walking-on-pedestrian-lane-during-daytime.html . Results obtained with the model trained on JackRabbot, Nuscenes, JAAD and Kitti. The model file is available at ```models/predictor``` and can be reused for testing with the predictor. 

## Abstract 

> In urban or crowded environments, humans rely on eye contact for fast and efficient communication with nearby people. Autonomous agents also need to detect eye contact to interact with pedestrians and safely navigate around them. In this paper, we focus on eye contact detection in the wild, i.e., real-world scenarios for autonomous vehicles with no control over the environment or the distance of pedestrians. We introduce a model that leverages semantic keypoints to detect eye contact and show that this high-level representation (i) achieves state-of-the-art results on the publicly-available dataset JAAD, and (ii) conveys better generalization properties than leveraging raw images in an end-to-end network. To study domain adaptation, we create LOOK: a large-scale dataset for eye contact detection in the wild, which focuses on diverse and unconstrained scenarios for real-world generalization. The source code and the LOOK dataset are publicly shared towards an open science mission.

## Requirements

Use ```3.6.9 <= python < 3.9```. Run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to get the dependencies

## Predictor

Get predictions from our pretrained model using any image with the predictor. The scripts extracts the human keypoints on the fly using [OpenPifPaf](https://openpifpaf.github.io/intro.html). The predictor supports eye contact detection using human keypoints only.
You need to specify the following arguments in order to run correctly the script:

| Parameter                 |Description   |
| :------------------------ |:-------------|
| ```--glob``` | Glob expression to be used. Example: ```.png``` |
| ```--images```  | Path to the input images. If glob is enabled you need the path to the directory where you have the query images |
| ```--looking_threshold```  | Threshold to define an eye contact. Default ```0.5```|
| ```--transparency```  | Transparency of the output poses. Default ```0.4```|

### Example command:

If you want to reproduce the result of the top image, run:

#### If you want to run the predictor on a GPU:
```
python predict.py --images images/people-walking-on-pedestrian-lane-during-daytime-3.jpg
```
#### If you want to run the predictor on a CPU:
```
python predict.py --images images/people-walking-on-pedestrian-lane-during-daytime-3.jpg --device cpu --disable-cuda
```

## Create the datasets for training and evaluation

Please follow the instructions on the folder [create_data](https://github.com/vita-epfl/looking/tree/main/create_data).

## Training your models on LOOK / JAAD / PIE

You have one config file to modify. **Do not change the variables name**. Check the meaning of each variable to change on the [training wiki](/wikis/train.md).

After changing your configuration file, run:

```python train.py --file [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE]```

A sample config file can be found at ```config_example.ini```

## Evaluate your trained models

Check the meaning of each variable to change on the [evaluation wiki](/wikis/eval.md).

After changing your configuration file, run:

```python evaluate.py --file [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE]```

A sample config file can be found at ```config_example.ini```

## Annotate new images

Check out the folder [annotator](https://github.com/vita-epfl/looking/tree/main/annotator) in order to run our annotator to annotate new instances for the task.
